In the context of your YOLOv8 model training, hereâ€™s the general difference between the two files:

best.pt:
This file typically represents the best-performing model during training. It's saved at the point in training when the model achieved the highest performance on the validation dataset, based on metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision). This is usually the model you want to use for inference as it tends to be the most generalized and effective.

last.pt:
This file represents the model saved at the last epoch of training, which may or may not be the best performing model. It contains the state of the model at the final point in training, regardless of the validation performance. If training had not converged or the model had overfitted in later epochs, this file might not perform as well as the best.pt.

Which to Use will depend on the following:
For best results, you should use the best.pt file, as it's the model that performed the best on the validation data during training.
If you need to continue training or want to inspect the final state of the model after training, you can use last.pt, but keep in mind that its performance might be slightly worse than the best.pt model.
If you're still unsure, it's usually safe to go with best.pt for inference.
